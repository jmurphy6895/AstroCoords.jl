AstroCoords.jl
================================

This package is intended to be a one stop shop for all things related to astrodynamics coordinate systems. In addition to being non-allocating and highly performant all transformations found here are also differentiable with compatibility with a number of different automatic and finite differencing schemas.

Currently this package implements:
- [x] Cartesian
- [x] Keplerian
- [x] Delaunay
- [x] Modified Equinoctial
- [x] Spherical
- [x] Cylindrical
- [x] Unified State Model
    - [x] USM7
    - [x] USM6
    - [x] USMEM
- [x] Milankovich
- [ ] J2 Modified Equinoctial
- [ ] EDROMO
- [ ] Kustaanheimo-Stiefel
- [ ] Stiefel-Scheifel

This package may eventually support Attitude Coordinates as well.
