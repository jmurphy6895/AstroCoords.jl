# Anomalies

There is support in the package to switch between the various anomalies -- True, Eccentric, and Mean along with a Kepler Solver based on a Netwon iterative method. These may be moved out to a separate package later to better support and experiment with various Kepler Solver methodologies.

# Usage

To convert between the anomalies use a simple function call works.

```julia
M = 2π * rand()
e = rand()

E = meanAnomaly2EccentricAnomaly(M, e)
```
